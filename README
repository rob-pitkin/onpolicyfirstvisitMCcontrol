Assignment: RL Homework 2
Class: CS-138 Reinforcement Learning
Author: Rob Pitkin

Required libraries/dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- copy

Run:
$ python agent.py grid_one.txt
$ python agent.py grid_two.txt

For user controls:
$ python main.py grid_one.txt
$ python main.py grid_two.txt

Notes:
I chose to prompt the user for inputs to make the implementation be able
to handle different experiments. In order to match the experiments done
in my report, one should input in this order:
- For default values:
    - n
    - n
- For custom values:
    - y
    - Your epsilon value as a float
    - y
    - Your gamma value as a float
